# RainstormStudios
A set of class libraries to aid in common tasks and extend .NET functionality.

Keep in mind that much of this code is quite old, and even my code structure patterns have changed slightly during that time.
If you see anything that should be updated or could be done better, feel free to fix it.

The RainstormStudios libraries include references to the following 3rd party libraries:

* AjaxControlToolkit
  * https://www.devexpress.com/products/ajax-control-toolkit/

* NCalc - a mathematical expressions evaluator in .NET
  * https://ncalc.codeplex.com/

* DynamicLinq - Scott Gu
